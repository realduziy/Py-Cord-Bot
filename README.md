This bot is being developed by duziy, if you need any help or have any suggestion or wish to even help me fell free to private message me via discord @ duziy#9305

NOTE: That this bot is still in a early stage of development! At some point I may use COGS when I under stand more about bots and python in general. I want this to be as simple as it can be so not using COGS is the best thing for me really.

Also do note that I don't claim to own any of the code that is used for this bot as most of it is from ChatGPT, StackOverflow, or Youtube!

What is PyCord-Bot?

PyCord-Bot is a simple multipurpose discord bot coded in python.

Main library that is being used is Pycord : github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord or just install it via this command to make sure its all correct : 
py -3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord


All of the pip installs that I am using should be, discord, discord-bridge, requests, random, asyncio, asyncpraw and if thats not all of them then it's not my problem!


To-do list:

Change everything over to cogs to clean it up more (I have no clue how I would do this I tried at some point and I kinda got lost so probably not going to any time soon)

Logging system for moderation and what not

Make it so you can set a custom messege via a command for the welcome and leave messege
