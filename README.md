This bot is being developed by duziy, If you need any help have any suggestions, or wish to help me feel free to private message me via discord @ duziy.

NOTE: This bot is still in an early stage of development! At some point, I may use COGS when I understand more about bots and Python in general. I want this to be as simple as it can be so learning COGS is not on my list of priorities for the time being.

Also do note that I don't claim to own any of the code that is used for this bot as most of it is from ChatGPT, StackOverflow, or Youtube!

What is PyCord-Bot?

PyCord-Bot is a simple multipurpose discord bot coded in Python.

The main library that is being used is Py-Cord. 
You can view it at https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord or install it via this command: 
py -3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord

All of the pip installs I am using should be, discord, discord-bridge, asyncio, asyncpraw and if I'm missing one feel free to let me know via discord or create an issue request, and I'll take a look into it. 

If you find a bug feel free to let me know via Discord or via an issue request but do note that I may not fix it for some time as I dont update this often.

Note:

Basic bot functionalities have been completed as of 5/1/2023
