This bot is being developed by duziy, if you need any help or have any suggestion or wish to even help me fell free to private message me via discord @ duziy#9305

NOTE: That this bot is still in a early stage of development! At some point I may use COGS when I under stand more about bots and python in general. I want this to be as simple as it can be so not using COGS is the best thing for me really.

Also do note that I don't claim to own any of the code that is used for this bot as most of it is from ChatGPT, StackOverflow, or Youtube!

What is PyCord-Bot?

PyCord-Bot is a simple multipurpose discord bot coded in python.

Main library that is being used is Pycord : github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord or just install it via this command to make sure its all correct : 
py -3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord


All of the pip installs that I am using should be, discord, discord-bridge, requests, random, asyncio, asyncpraw and if thats not all of them then it's not my problem!


To-do list:

Recode some commands again to make it cleaner (I've already started doing that a little bit)

Change everything over to cogs to clean it up more (I have no clue how I would do this I tried at some point and I kinda got lost so probably not going to any time soon)

Logging System (Be able to edit what you want to be logged)

Auto Moderation (Be able to edit what you want to be logged)

Ticket System

Verification System

Better over all error handling as sometimes it will log stuff in console that it does not need to
