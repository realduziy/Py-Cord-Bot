This bot is being developed by: duziy#9305

NOTE: That this bot is still in a very early stage of development therefore there is not a lot of commands and I am not using cogs yet! At some point I may use them when I under stand more about bots and python in general. I want this to be as simple as it can be so not using cogs right now is the best thing for me really.

What is PyCord-Bot you may be asking?

Well it is a simple multipurpose discord bot coded in python.

I do not claim to own any of the code that is used for this bot as most of it is from ChatGPT, StackOverflow, or Youtube!

Main library I am using:

github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord

All of the pip installs that it should be using and if not it's not my problem!

discord, requests, random, asyncio, asyncpraw

To-do list:

Change everything over to cogs to clean it up more (I have like no clue how I would do this I tried at some point and I kinda got lost so probably not going to any time soon)
Logging system for moderation and what not
Add a welcome and leave message, have it so you can set what channel it is in
