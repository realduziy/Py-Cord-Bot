This bot is being developed by Duziy. If you need help, have any suggestions, or wish to help me, feel free to private message me via Discord @ duziy. Feel free to submit pull request if you have suggestions and i'll take a look at it at some point.

NOTE: This bot is still in an early stage of development! At some point, I will use COGS when I have a better understanding of Python. I want this to be as simple as it can be so learning COGS is not on my list of priorities.

I don't claim to own any of the code that is used for this bot, as most of it is from ChatGPT, StackOverflow, and Youtube!

What is PyCord-Bot?

PyCord-Bot is a simple multipurpose discord bot coded in Python.

The main library that is being used is Discord.py. 

You can view it at https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py. 

You will need to install these packages. You can install them with the following command, as long as you have requerments.txt in the same folder. 

pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

If you find a bug, feel free to let me know via Discord or via an issue request, but do note that I may not fix it for some time as I don't update this often.

To-do list:

Change everything over to cogs to clean it up more. (This will be at a later date when I have better understanding of python.)

Logging System (Basic version is done) (For the Log Auto-Moderation stuff and for the Ticket system, you can change what channel it puts the Transcripts in, and for the Verification system, it logs when someone Verifys successfully or not.)

Auto-Moderation (Be able to edit what you want to be logged)

Ticket System (Finished, but work on it more when I feel like it.)

Verification System

Make a better lockdown command and make it so you can select what channels you want the lockdown command to lockdown by default. If there is none, it will just be the channel that you sent the command in.

Add music to Spotify and Youtube.
