This bot is being developed by duziy, If you need any help have any suggestions, or wish to help me feel free to private message me via discord @ duziy.

NOTE: This bot is still in an early stage of development! At some point, I may use COGS when I understand more about bots and Python in general. I want this to be as simple as it can be so learning COGS is not on my list of priorities for the time being.

Also do note that I don't claim to own any of the code that is used for this bot as most of it is from ChatGPT, StackOverflow, or Youtube!

What is PyCord-Bot?

PyCord-Bot is a simple multipurpose discord bot coded in Python.

The main library that is being used is Py-Cord. 

You can view it at https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord or install it via this command:

You will also need to install these packeges, you can install them with the following commands, 

py -m pip install discord

py -m pip install asyncio

py -m pip install aiohttp

py -m pip install python-dotenv

If you find a bug feel free to let me know via Discord or via an issue request but do note that I may not fix it for some time as I dont update this often.

Note:

Basic bot functionalities have been completed as of 5/1/2023

To-do list:

Change everything over to cogs to clean it up more (This will be at a later date as I do not know how to really do this yet)

Logging System (Be able to edit what you want to be logged) (Logs Auto-Moderation stuff and for the Ticket System you can change what channel it puts the Transcripts in, and for the Verification System it logs when someone Verifys successfully or not.)

Auto-Moderation (Be able to edit what you want to be logged)

Ticket System

Verification System

Make a better lockdown command and make it so you can select what channels you want the lockdown command to lockdown by default. If there is none it will just be the channel that you sent the command in.
