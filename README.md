This bot is being developed by duziy, If you need any help have any suggestion, or wish to help me feel free to private message me via discord @ duziy

NOTE: This bot is still in an early stage of development! At some point, I may use COGS when I understand more about bots and Python in general. I want this to be as simple as it can be so not using COGS is the best thing for me really.

Also do note that I don't claim to own any of the code that is used for this bot as most of it is from ChatGPT, StackOverflow, or Youtube!

What is PyCord-Bot?

PyCord-Bot is a simple multipurpose discord bot coded in Python.

The main library that is being used is Pycord: github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord or just install it via this command to make sure it's all correct : 
py -3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord

All of the pip installs that I am using should be, discord, discord-bridge, requests, random, asyncio, asyncpraw and if that's not all of them then it's not my problem!


Note:

Basic bot functionalities have been completed as of 5/1/2023

To-do list:

Recode some commands again to make it cleaner (I've already started doing that a little bit)

Change everything over to cogs to clean it up more (This will be at a later date as I do not know how to really do this yet)

Logging System (Be able to edit what you want to be logged)

Auto Moderation (Be able to edit what you want to be logged)

Ticket System

Verification System

Better over all error handling as sometimes it will log stuff in console that it does not need to
