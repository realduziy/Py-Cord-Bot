This bot is being developed by: duziy#9305

NOTE: That this bot is still in a very early stage of development therefore there is not a lot of commands and I am not using cogs yet! At some point I may use them when I under stand more about bots but as it stands right now I will not. I want this to be as simple as it can be.

What is Py-Cord-Bot you may be asking?

Well it is a simple multipurpose discord bot coded in python.

I do not claim to own any of the code that is used for this bot as most of it is from ChatGPT, StackOverflow, or Youtube!

Library I am using:

<https://github.com/Pycord-Development/pycord>

All of the pip installs that it should be using and if not it's not my problem!
